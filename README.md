The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/mÂ², resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.  Calculate Your Body Mass Index. Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.
